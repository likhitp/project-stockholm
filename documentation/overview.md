## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **Document Processor**
   - Handles text-based PDF files
   - Extracts text content
   - Normalizes output for LLM processing

2. **LLM Pipeline**
   - Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview for event extraction and analysis
   - Implements streaming processing for better performance
   - Includes comprehensive error handling

3. **User Interface**
   - Simple file upload
   - Case description input
   - Results display
   - Download functionality

4. **Date Processing System**
   - Standardized date parsing (YYYY-MM-DD format)
   - Multiple format support with fallback mechanisms
   - Timezone handling and standardization
   - Error logging and validation
   - Integration with LLM processing pipeline

### Data Flow

1. User uploads PDF documents and enters case description
2. Backend processes documents to extract text
3. Gemini processes each document to identify events
4. Events from all documents are combined
5. Gemini reasons over combined events to establish chronology
6. Chronology is formatted as markdown table
7. Result is displayed to user and made available for download
